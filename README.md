# Crypto Decrypted: A welcome guide for latecomers

### This website was inspired by the countless friends who have approached me asking what the big deal is with crypto, or what it's really about.
### My solution was to create a user friendly, light-weight sigle page resource to explain the basis of crypto, blockchain and web3 in my own words - focusing on accessability to a non-technical crowd.

### The website utilises:
    - React
    - React Spring library (Parralax)
    - Graphics created by myslef
